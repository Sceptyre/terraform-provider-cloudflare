```release-note:bug
resource/cloudflare_api_shield_operation: fixed a bug when using variable names other than `var1 ... varN` in endpoint definitions causing these resources to be recreated when nothing has changed.
If this affects you, after upgrading to this version, the resource has to be recreated once more to fix the state, after which the bug is fixed.
